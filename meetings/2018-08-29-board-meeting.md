# Ruby Together board meeting summary

**August 29, 2018**

**Attendees and Agenda**
Valerie, Jonan, Allison, Adarsh, Coraline, Courtney, and André were present. 

Topics for discussion included:
- Work on the Ruby Me OSS internship/mentorship proposal 
- Review a new proposed granting process
- Getting new members

## Goodbye Courtney and new board size
Courtney has decided to step down as a board member. We thank her for all her work and service to the organization. Based on Courtney’s departure and Andre’s new role which includes stepping down from being a board member, the board discussed having a board of 5 instead of 7 as is more standard with other nonprofits and will be easier for coordination purposes.

## [Ruby Me](http://rubyme.org)
Ruby Me will be announced soon. We’ll be sure to do outreach to make sure folks know about the opportunity.

## Grant Funding
Grant funding is almost ready to go. All the parts are complete, we just need to check with a lawyer about providing grants.

## Insurance
We’re going to secure liability insurance.

## New members/increasing revenue
Our membership numbers aren’t growing and therefore out revenue is staying steady or dropping. Allison and Jonan are working together on a subcommittee to brainstorm revenue generating ideas and ideas for increasing membership numbers.
