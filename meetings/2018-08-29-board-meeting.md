# Ruby Together board meeting summary

**August 29, 2018**

**Attendees and Agenda**

Valerie, Jonan, Allison, Adarsh, Coraline, Courtney, and André were present. 

Topics for discussion included:

- Working on the RubyMe OSS mentorship proposal 
- Reviewing a new proposed granting process
- Getting new members

## Goodbye Courtney, and New Board Size

Courtney has decided to step down as a board member. We thank her for all her work and service to the organization. 

Based on Courtney’s departure and André’s new role, which includes stepping down from being a board member, the board discussed capping the board's size to five instead of seven. A board consisting of five members is more standard with other nonprofits, and will be easier for coordination purposes.

## [RubyMe](http://rubyme.org)

RubyMe will be announced soon. We’ll be sure to do outreach to make sure folks know about the opportunity.

## Grant Funding

Grant funding is almost ready to go. All the parts are complete; we just need to check with a lawyer about providing grants.

## Insurance

We’re going to secure liability insurance.

## New Members and Increasing Revenue

Our membership numbers aren’t growing; therefore, our revenue is staying steady or dropping. Allison and Jonan are working together on a subcommittee to brainstorm revenue generating ideas and ideas for increasing membership numbers.
