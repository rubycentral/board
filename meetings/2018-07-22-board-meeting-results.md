# Ruby Together board meeting summary from July 22, 2018

## Attendees and Agenda

AndrÃ©, Coraline, Courteney, Valerie, Adarsh, and Jonan were present.

Topics for discussion included welcoming Jonan to the board, Work on the RubyMe OSS internship/mentorship proposal, review a new proposed granting process, and finally ratifying the new Executive Director role.

## Welcome Jonan!

The board is excited to welcome Jonan Scheffler as our newest board member.

## Ruby Me

The board reviewed and unanimously approved sponsorship of a new program called "RubyMe". It's a paid open source apprenticeship which matches an experienced OSS developer with an early-career developer to work on an OSS project together. From the proposal:

> The mission of the RubyMe program is to help early-career developers improve their skills and confidence by contributing to Ruby open source projects. Through this program we hope to give these developers the skills and experience that they need for continued growth and success in their careers.
>
> RubyMe pairs seasoned Rubyists with early-career developers to explore mutual growth, learning, and teaching opportunities. These pairs work on open source projects and focus on whatever areas that the mentee wants to improve in, from documentation and design to testing, security, or general development.
>
> We will have a formal application process for mentees and mentors to ensure good pairings and appropriate skills.
>
> We are very excited to offer a paid mentorship opportunity for our communities newer developers, and especially in helping them prepare to contribute open source software.

We plan to solicit mentors and mentees to apply in August, review applications in September, pilot the program with a few pairs in October, gather feedback in December, and launch in January.

## Grant Funding

To formalize our support of Ruby open-source projects, we will be transitioning to a grant-based model over the course of the rest of the year. As our organization matures, we need to evolve our processes and add appropriate bureaucracy and this is one part of it.  During this meeting, we voted in favor of this new program.

From our draft grant proposal:

> In support of its mission to sustain the open source Ruby ecosystem, Ruby Together is now offering grant funding to open source software projects. New projects will be considered for funding every three months and reviewed by a committee of members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Director.

Applications are accepted on a rolling basis and must be submitted by a maintainer of the project. Ideal projects:

- Are open source software projects
- Contribute to the Ruby ecosystem
- Support the Ruby Together goals, mission, vision, and values
- Treat contributors equally, have a code of conduct with a clear enforcement policy, and are willing to expand their existing CoC if deemed necessary by the selection committee

Application reviews will be conducted initially by the RT board. Over time, we will add reviewers from the wider Ruby community including past grant recipients, RT members, or other at-large Rubyists.

Like all things we do, we will prototype this initially, gather feedback from everyone involved, and slowly expand/grow the program as appropriate.

We are working on formal announcements and will share the details of this program publicly in the next few months.

## Liability Review

We had some questions about what our legal liability was and our access to a lawyer. We discussed officer liability insurance and our historical usage of a lawyer. No decisions were made; we will investigate the availability/need/cost of liability insurance and discuss further at the next meeting.

## Executive Director Role

We will be transitioning our CEO role to a more formal Executive Director position. During the meeting, we reviewed the proposed job description and voted to ratify it. We discussed the mechanics of the job including things like responsibilities, compensation, PTO, benefits (if any), and performance reviews.

We are feel this is a healthy evolution of our organization and position us for success in the future. We will share a more public announcement later in the year.
