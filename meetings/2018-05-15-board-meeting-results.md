# Ruby Together board meeting summary from May 15, 2018

## Attendees and agenda

The full board was present. Topics for discussion included feedback from the community, project funding process, and how to structure company administration work.

### New Funding Models

The board collectively reviewed feedback from Ruby community members. We decided to use that feedback to inform our upcoming work to create a standard, clear process for funding new projects.

We will be discussing how to move forward with new funding models at our next board meeting.


### Existing processes

Based on both external and internal feedback, we also decided to write and publish a document clearly explaining our existing processes and publications.

As part of structuring and defining our administration work, we decided to create job descriptions for the executive management, project management, and engineering management roles taken on by employees of Ruby Together.

### Meeting Frequency
As part of increasing the speed of the board's work overall, we agreed to meet once per month for the next 3 months instead of our usual quarterly meetings, with a re-evaluation later this summer.

## Feedback
Thank you everyone for your thoughts and feedback and, as always, the board is willing to have additional conversations. You can reach out to us in the Ruby Together members GitHub repo, or by email at feedback@rubytogether.org.
