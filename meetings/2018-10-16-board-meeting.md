# Ruby Together board meeting summary

**October 16, 2018**

**Attendees and Agenda**

André, Mandy, Coraline, Allison, Valerie, Jonan were present.

Topics for discussion included Ruby Me, project applications, DevRel hire and prospectus updates, and sponsoring Ruby Karaoke at RubyConf.

### Ruby Me

The launch went really well, we had a massive number of applications, and the first cohort of students and mentors has started meeting to work together.

### Project applications

After consulting with our lawyer, our goals are better met by a call for project proposals rather than giving out grants. As a result, André will be writing a website page with information about project proposals and preparing a proposal form.

### DevRel and prospectus updates

Our DevRel job description was approved unanimously by the board, and next steps include a written hiring and interview process, to be approved by the board. We continue to iterate on new versions of the prospectus for interested individuals and companies, and hope to have something finished by the next board meeting.

### Sponsoring Karaoke

The board voted unanimously to co-sponsor Ruby Karaoke at RubyConf.
