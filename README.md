# Ruby Together Board of Directors
Proceedings, Documents, and Processes for the Ruby Together Board of Directors

## Overview

This repository contains the documents and other materials related to the operations of the Ruby Together board.

Our goals in creating this repo are:

1. Centralize all board governance documents and artifacts
2. Increase transparency for the members and public
3. Provide a conduit for member and public feedback

Like all things, this is an experiment and first draft. We will be improving our processes and sharing additional information as needs arise and context changes.

## Communication

### How to Share Feedback with Ruby Together (Inbound)

#### Public

To share public feedback, open an issue in this repository. It can be about anything, it's just a central place to collect input from outside of the board.

As we discuss then resolve those issues, we will close the issue.

#### Private

To share private feedback, please email [feedback@rubytogether.org](mailto:feedback@rubytogether.org). That address will forward to all of the directors on the board.

### How to Keep Up to Date with Ruby Together (Outbound)

To our best ability, we will set up channels to share out information as it happens in order to keep our membership informed and build trust with the broader community.
